# Forecast_Hourly_Humidity
---

The goal of this app is try different forecasting methods to obtain the best forecast for high frequency data. I found a dataset that contains the hourly relative humidity in Albany, New York for roughly 7 years. I know little about weather data and thought it could be a fun challenge to try and forecast!
The Shiny app I developed can be accessed using the following link: https://fisher-latham.shinyapps.io/Hourly_Humidity_Forecast/
